              I am a software engineering student at the University of Ottawa. At the time of writing, my interests are in the areas of web development. I like the idea of having the user use your tool regardless of the device and operating system. I believe that the user experience for your tool should be identical (or as close as it can be) on all platforms and devices. My current interests are in the area of web development.

              Casey is super awesome and very enthusiastic. I just copy pasted the rest from his The "Casey Li Resume" Web Application which was built using Ruby on Rails. It was meant to showcase Casey's core skills in using Ruby on Rails. Although most of what regular users will see will be the Resume listings, there is a fully interactive Web Application for administrators who sign in. They can fully manage Resume Entry Types, Resume Entries, and Resume Entry Notes.
